## Hi!

I have interests in various topics such as web programming, programming languages, and using/developing tools for developers.

Currently, I am a missionary of [The Church of Jesus Christ, Latter-day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng). I will be on my mission from Aug. 2023 to Aug. 2025. During my mission, I will not be available for contact regarding software development, as I will be devoting all of my time into missionary work.
